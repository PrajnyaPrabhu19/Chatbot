# Chatbot
A simple chatbot which will correct the misspelt words and does a wikipedia search for a topic

Following libraries need to be installed first. Execute the following command:
pip install wikipedia
pip install pyspellchecker 

Run the Chatty.py. It is not a perfect chatbot. The wikipedia.summary() function which is used in the program, searches for the article 
with the given topic name. Hence sometimes it will return with "Content not found" response or it will return summary based on the 
nearest term article it finds.

Happy exploring!
